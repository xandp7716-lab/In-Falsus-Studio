# Compatibility and chart extensions

## Current snapshot

InFalsus Studio+ public version **1.06**, integrated assembly **1.0.70.0**. The original Unity editor core remains 1.0.10. The current plugin preserves every pasted note's SkyArea `groupid` and timinggroup; missing timinggroups are recreated with captured header properties. This intentionally differs from the unmodified core's default paste behavior. Other pre-existing groups are not repurposed.

The universal `output: spc` interface supports syntax-checked SPC rows and append/replace/delete patches, including supported nonofficial statements and opaque function-like statements. It retains unknown text without claiming playback semantics or official-game compatibility. See [EXTERNAL_TOOLS.md](EXTERNAL_TOOLS.md).

The deletion/copy Timing tools now have built-in quick-tool entries; their legacy scripts remain compatible. Bracket tunnel and random scatter are optional add-ons, not extra mandatory defaults. Existing tools are not rewritten just to use the universal interface.

## Runtime target

- Editor plugin: InFalsus Studio Windows Mono 1.0.10, `Assembly-CSharp.dll` SHA-256 `C4C3D6118A19F9BCB1F7D33B29C340DB0F33580655744473B23187E9D3C4E417`.
- Community player target for the chart extension: InFalsus shell `inf-mod6`, version 1.0.6, build 25797904. A public source repository/tag for that shell was not supplied.
- Editor-side integration and source regression records exist for the plugin build; the actual scopes and historical/current distinction are listed in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). Loading and playing timinggroup charts in the target game shell, including judgment behavior, have **not been verified** by this commit.

## Extension syntax

The optional plugin recognizes these nonofficial chart statements:

```text
timinggroup(name):
    ... notes and timing events ...
groupend()
hidegroup(time_ms, 0_or_1)
```

`timinggroup(name,noinput):` and `timinggroup(name,noclip):` are also accepted. Names contain 1–64 Unicode letters/digits, `_` or `-`, and cannot begin with a digit. Groups cannot nest or reuse a name; the `chart(...)` header belongs in the base section. Group markers delimit following source lines through `groupend()`.

All groups share absolute song time. Each group has its own event stream. A non-base group inherits base `track` and `bpm` events of each kind until it defines its first local event of that kind; after that, that kind follows the local stream. `track` controls scroll speed; `bpm` controls beat-grid and count estimates. SkyArea `groupid` remains a separate visual/head-connection value and does not encode timinggroup membership.

`noinput` notes remain visible but are excluded from editor preview judgment, autocursor hits, hit sounds, and counts; the editor preview clips them at its judgment line. `noclip` also disables judgment and continues rendering past the line. These describe editor behavior. Their gameplay semantics in a player are not certified here. `hidegroup` applies to the current timinggroup: `1` hides its note visibility and `0` shows it; the latest event at or before the selected absolute time applies. Visibility does not itself suppress judgment or sound.

Legacy external timing tools operate within the selected timinggroup. Universal SPC patches can explicitly target base/other timinggroups or complete group blocks, with request-snapshot and authoring validation. Defaults remain in `ExternalTools/Default`; optional generators are in `ExternalTools/Optional`, documented in the [tool overview](EXTERNAL_TOOLS.md) and individual tool READMEs.

## Official compatibility and export

The official editor/game format does not implement `timinggroup`, `noinput`, `noclip`, or `hidegroup` semantics. Without the optional plugin, the original editor has no timinggroup editor. With the plugin installed, Save and Save As preserve the extension statements as chart text; this version does not flatten them, remove them, or block saving as an official-format conversion. Do not treat a saved extended chart as playable by an official build. Use a player known to support the exact extension, and validate gameplay separately.

Installation is the explicit opt-in for the editor extension. Once installed, the plugin automatically recognizes the statements when present; it does not silently enable a per-chart official mode or migrate a chart on open. This commit does not add a compatibility toggle or an official-export conversion path.

## Other visual boundary

The plugin's optional out-of-bounds Sky authoring grid and Alt handles are editor features. They are not a guarantee that all modified players support every generated coordinate. Respect the target player's supported ranges and validate gameplay separately.
